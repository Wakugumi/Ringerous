## Why

It's an assessment on our Ring theory class.

## How to use

Run this in your environment

```python
python3 app.py
```

If you use Linux, you probably have to create an environment

```bash
python3 -m venv <YOUR_DESIRED_ENV_NAME>
```

Then activate your current shell session to the env

```bash
source <PATH_TO_YOUR_ENV>/bin/activate
```

You have to install some packages before using your environment, use our requirements file.
First, change to this project directory, then

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally run the app.

### Note

In the app, you can either validate an cyclic group of integers module _n_, where you can enter _n_ in the input box.
You can also test your own set by using in the "tests" folder, in there you'll find example in JSON files.
You can upload batches of JSON file to be validated.
You can Export the result in a CSV or TXT file.
